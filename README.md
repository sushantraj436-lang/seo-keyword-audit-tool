# 🔍 SEO Keyword Audit Tool

A Python-based SEO audit prototype built to analyze on-page keyword usage from a given URL.  
This tool extracts webpage content, processes text data, and generates structured JSON output highlighting frequently used service-related keywords.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to understand how SEO analysis can be automated using Python by:

- Extracting webpage content programmatically
- Cleaning and processing textual data
- Identifying important keywords
- Structuring SEO insights into JSON format

This project is intended as a learning and workflow demonstration tool rather than a production-grade SEO software.
